# Chasqui - Insalco
This web application is very similar to Chasqui-EmprendeXChile. However, this was the first version of the app, which was developed for a business tournament called "Jovenes empresarios". <br/>
The main difference between this project and the newer one should be the database. For this project I used flask-SQLAlchemy, whereas firebase-realtimedatabase was used. 
<br/>
This webpage also doesn't support user auth, a fact that shows that I was at an early phase of my web development learning process. Furthermore, if you compare this website with the newer one, you should immediately notice that the frontend improved **a lot**.
